# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to preprocess the Alphabet Soup's data, using the Deep Learning Neural Network Model technique, create and optimize a model that will predict if the charity money donations were used successfully. 

The data set contained the metadata for over 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphbet Soup. Below are dataset columns organized by input and output values: 

| Input Value  | Output Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| EIN  | IS_SUCCESSFUL  |
| NAME |  |
| APPLICATION_TYPE  |
| AFFILIATION  |  |
| CLASSIFICATION  |  |
| ORGANIZATION  |  |
| STATUS  |  |
| INCOME_AMT |  |
| SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS  |  |
| ASK_AMT  |  |
| IS_SUCCESSFUL  |  |

## Results

After processing the data, I designed a deep learning model to predict if a funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset using TensorFlow. After a successful model execution with nn.fit() function, the loss score was 72% and accuracy 44%.
